			<p>The weather is the most crucial factor when deciding to visit Jaipur. Do not consider visiting Jaipur during the long hot summer (March until July) when the daytime maximum temperatures can reach in excess of 45°C. This intense heat combined with the dust and pollution makes Jaipur unbearable and this is the worst season to visit the whole of India. If you do plan to visit Jaipur in the summer always book air-conditioning in hotels is essential and drink plenty of water.The winter months (November through to February) is the best time of the year to visit Jaipur and the weather is dry, warm and sunny. As this is considered the height of the tourist season hotel’s charge maximum prices and some of the more popular hotels are sold out. In the middle of winter Jaipur has cool evenings, with temperatures dropping to around 5°C and it often surprises visitors that they may need a warm jumper.
